FOR TILE FITTING, USE MODULAR DIVISION

FOR SPHERE USE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM
DIAGONAL TO ORIGIN (0,0) FROM C^2 CREATES ANOTHER TIRANGLE TO Z-POINT, USING Z POINT AS HEIGHT, WHITH C BEING X-AXIS, AND HYPOTENUSE BEING RADIUS, WHICH = 1 ALWAYS. 
SO FINAL FORMULA WOULD WE X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2 <= 1   (FOR A POINT TO BE INSIDE THE SPHERE).
