My name is Alberto Montalvo and I am majoring in Computer Game Design. This means that I have leveraged the usefuleness of many softwares and have a great understanding of the hardware that is needed to make games. From Pro Tools and 3DS Max, to Illustrator, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and InDesign.

This is a customer-oriented position that requires you to have in-depth knowledge of the hardware components of a computer and the use of the EasyVista ticketing system.
